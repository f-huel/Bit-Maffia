# Bit-Mafia

## Intro
BIT FCM is the Bit Academy (Purmerend) Party Committee, created by Bit-Mafia.
We came on this idea, because we tought it would be nice if our school would have some events or parties.
We will be organizing these, but we also wanted the other students to give ideas. Since the other students don't know about it yet, we decided to create a website.
They can see what we do, give ideas and get in touch with us. We hope that when we get our diploma they'll continue with our idea, but who knows, we'll see!
