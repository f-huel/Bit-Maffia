# Bit-Mafia

## Intro
BIT FCM (BIT stands for the Bit in Bit academy and the FCM stands for Feestcommissie, but also for our names (you'll find those later in this README!)) is the Bit Academy (Purmerend) Party Committee, created by Bit-Mafia. We got this idea, because we thought it would be cool if our school (Bit Academy) would have some events or parties. We will be organizing these, but we also want the other students to give ideas. Since the other students don't know about it yet, we decided to create a website. They can see what we do, give ideas and get in touch with us. We hope that when we get our degree they'll continue with our idea, but who knows, we'll see!
